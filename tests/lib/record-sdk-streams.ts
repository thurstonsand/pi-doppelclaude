// Costs subscription quota, so it is not part of `mise run test`. Re-run it when
// the SDK is bumped, then read the diff: a changed fixture is the SDK changing
// shape under us, which is the whole reason these are recorded rather than
// written by hand.
//
// Prompts are deliberately trivial and the tool calls read a scratch file this
// script creates, so no fixture carries repo or conversation content. The SDK's
// own envelope still does: `system/init` reports the absolute cwd and the user's
// entire personal slash-command and agent list, and every message carries live
// uuids. scrub() below strips that, keeping only the fields consumeQuery reads.
// Never commit a fixture that has not been through it.
